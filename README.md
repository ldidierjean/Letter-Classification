# Letter-Classification

This project is a mobile app that allows the user to classify handwritten letters.

The apk in the root folder is the pre-built app.

The "app" folder contains a Kotlin project that can be compiled into an Android app using Gradle with Android Studio.

The "training" folder contains Python code which is used to train and and build the TensorFlow Lite model that we're using in the mobile app.

To install the required Python packages for training, under the "training" folder, use the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
